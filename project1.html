  <h1>Project 1: <br> Low Poly Character</h1>

  <h3>For this project I am making a low poly 3D character in blender for a game later in the year. For this 
    charater I need to model it, rig it and animate it.</h3>

<h3>My end users are kids and teenagers between the ages 8-18. The game will have a simpler
  art style and have an easier diffculty for younger audiences. The game will also use stratagy and 
have harder options. The game will also have some darker elements and while the main character is cute
for younger audiences the enemies won't be as cute for older audiences and the main character and enemies
also have little colour for older audiences. I will also give the character quite cartoonish and robotic animations
for younger auidences.</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Requirements and Specifications</h2>

<h3>For this game the character needs to be able to move, dodge, block and attack. I also want the
  character to be able to change their limbs into different ones with different abilties so
  the player has to use stratagy and choose what combos they want to make. So the character
  needs to have quite a basic template which I can change and they need to have limbs which
  can be easly animated.

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Relevant Implications</h2>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Aesthetics</h2>
<h3>My character will have simple and boxy shapes in order to show that the character
  is inorganic and robotic and to make this character feel a lot less aggersive, 
  estatict, unstable and scheming then the sharp enemies around it expect for its sharp 
  teeth which it only shows in combat to show that this machine is not entirely harmless.
  I will also use grays and dim colours to show how the machine is not a part of the natural 
  world.
</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Functionality</h2>
<h3> I added joints in between the limbs and bent them to allow for easy and 
  smooth animations and rigging.</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Usability</h2>
<h3>I made my character very simple and made it human like so people can easily understand the design
  while still understanding it is a robot.
</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Intellectual Property</h2>
<h3>I changed the head and body of my character to make sure that it is very different then other
  characters

  <h1>Project 1: <br> Low Poly Character</h1>

  <h3>For this project I am making a low poly 3D character in blender for a game later in the year. For this charater I need to model it, rig it and animate it.</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">End users</h2>

<h3>My end users are kids and teenagers between the ages 8-18. The game will have a simpler
  art style and have an easier diffculty for younger audiences. The game will also use stratagy and 
have harder options. The game will also have some darker elements and while the main character is cute
for younger audiences the enemies won't be as cute for older audiences and the main character and enemies
also have little colour for older audiences. </h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Requirements and Specifications</h2>

<h3>For this game the character needs to be able to move, dodge, block and attack. I also want the
  character to be able to change their limbs into different ones with different abilties so
  the player has to use stratagy and choose what combos they want to make. So the character
  needs to have quite a basic template which I can change and they need to have limbs which
  can be easly animated.

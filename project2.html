  <h1>Project 2: <br> Low Poly Character</h1>

  <h3>For this project I made a low poly 3D character in blender for a game later in the year. For this 
    charater I modeled it, did some rigging but run out of time on animating. This character is a very cartoonish
  robot and simple so it can be easily understood, attract younger auidences and having a lighter less heavy feel.</h3>

<h3>My end users are kids and teenagers between the ages 7-20. The game will have a simpler
  art style and have an easier diffculty for younger audiences. The game will also use stratagy and 
have harder options. The game will also have some darker elements and while the main character is cute
for younger audiences the enemies won't be as cute for older audiences and the main character and enemies
also have little colour for older audiences. I will also give the character quite cartoonish and robotic animations
for younger auidences.</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Requirements and Specifications</h2>
<h3>For this game the character needs to be able to move, dodge, block and attack. I also want the
  character to be able to change their limbs into different ones with different abilties so
  the player has to use stratagy and choose what combos they want to make. So the character
  needs to have quite a basic template which I can change and they need to have limbs which
  can be easly animated.

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Relevant Implications</h2>
<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Aesthetics</h2>
<h3>My character will have simple and boxy shapes in order to show that the character
  is inorganic and robotic and to make this character feel a lot less aggersive, 
  estatict, unstable and scheming then the sharp enemies around it expect for its sharp 
  teeth which it only shows in combat to show that this machine is not entirely harmless.
  I will also use grays and dim colours to show how the machine is not a part of the natural 
  world.
</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Functionality</h2>
<h3> I added joints in between the limbs and bent them to allow for easy and 
  smooth animations and rigging.</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Usability</h2>
<h3>I made my character very simple and made it human like so people can easily understand the design
  while still understanding it is a robot.
</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Intellectual Property</h2>
<h3>I changed the head and body of my character to make sure that it is very different then other
  characters.

<h2 style="font-size: 50px;">Development</h2>

<h3>For this task I designed and created a 3D design of a robot. In order to make this I first made a copy
  of the design on paper which I then later put on blender to use as a baseplate for my model. I modelled my
  character limb by limb using the sheet. I tried using instructions given to us but due to me chosing to make my
  inorganic and unsmooth and overall different from the instructions they didn't really work all to well so I did
  most of the model myself. I also had a problem in which I found it very hard to do my work at home so I could only
  really do my work at school. I made a test character also on blender and I used its head for the acutal character's 
  head.

</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Testing</h2>
<img style="border-radius: 100px;" class="rightimage" src="images\p2\head.png">
<h3>For this model I first made a test character in which I tried to see how I was going to make this model and how I
  could make it's jaws aswell as how to make them working which took a large portion of my time.
</h3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Feedback</h2>
<H3>
Does this character suit its intended audience? Why or why not?
<ol style="font-weight: lighter;">
<li>The head is to big.</li>
<li>The head would be really good if it was bigger because of it would allow it to be cartoonish for kids while not 
being to big to be complety unrealistic for older audiences.
</li>
</ol>
What do you think of the proportions?
<ol style="font-weight: lighter;">
  <li>It’s good but make the character’s legs bigger to make it less top heavy.</li>
  <li>The arms are to low to be realistic put them higher.</li>
  </ol>
</H3>

<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Improvements</h2>
<h3>While one of the feedbacks was to make the head bigger another feedback was to make it bigger so I desided to do
  something in the middle which I think works really well. I also made the legs bigger to make the proportions better
  and put the arms higher to make it more realistic. I think these changes made the design a lot better.
